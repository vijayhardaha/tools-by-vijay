# 🛠️ Tools by Vijay

**Tools by Vijay** is a personal project — a curated collection of online utilities I frequently use as a developer, writer, and web creator. I built this site to centralize these helpful tools for myself, and I figured others might find them useful too.

From slug generation to code minification, every tool is designed to be fast, lightweight, and privacy-friendly — no tracking, no fluff.

## ✨ Why I Built This

I often found myself switching between different online tools spread across multiple websites. So I created **Tools by Vijay** to bring them together under one clean interface. It’s simple, fast, and focused on just what’s needed — no ads, no distractions.
